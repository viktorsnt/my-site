story:
- {lang: en, title: My Story, text: "Premeditated. No, perfection wasn’t planned. It happened. Friends together. An unscripted meeting of gin‐minded minds, accidentally stumbling onto the notion of a unique tipple. Some memorable nights, congregating on the Chesterfield, prophetic rantings, laughs, seated, heated discussions.<br><br>The upshot? A challenge. To craft a great liquid for genuine people. Artisan. Argued. Researched. Shaped. Imagined behind closed doors. A fine gin born of roguish sociability."}
